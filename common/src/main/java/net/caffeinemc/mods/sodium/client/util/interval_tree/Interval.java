/**
 * A representation of a generic interval. The interval can be open or closed (the start
 * and end points may be inclusive or exclusive), as well as bounded and unbounded (it can
 * extend to positive or negative infinity).
 * <p>
 * The class doesn't assume that the intervals are numeric, instead it is generalized to
 * represent a contiguous subset of elements, where contiguity is defined with respect to
 * an arbitrary total order function. These elements can be for example {@link java.util.Date}s
 * or basically any type, the elements of which can be compared to one another. Since the
 * class requires its generic variable to implement the {@link Comparable} interface, all
 * comparisons in the internals of the {@code Interval} class are done via the interface method.
 * <p>
 * When subclassing the {@code Interval} class, note that the start and end points of the
 * interval <strong>can</strong> be {@code null}. A {@code null} start point represents
 * the negative infinity and a {@code null} end point represents positive infinity. This
 * fact needs to be kept in mind in particular when overwriting methods with default
 * implementations in the {@code Interval} class, such as {@link #contains(Comparable)},
 * {@link #isLeftOf(Comparable)}, and in particular {@link #equals(Object)} and
 * {@link #hashCode()}.
 *
 * @param <T> The type that represents a single point from the domain of definition of the
 *            interval.

     * A method that should be overwritten by subclasses of {@code Interval}, if they have properties
     * that characterize the objects of the class and are used to identify them. It is used to create
     * a total order between distinct objects, that would otherwise be considered equal, if only
     * the start and end points were considered. If you don't have any such special properties, you
     * may leave the default implementation of this method.
     * <p>
     * This method functions as a traditional {@link Comparator}, bit can not and should not be used
     * on its own, nor should it be implemented as a full standalone comparator. Instead, it is always
     * used in conjunction with one of the two base {@link Comparator}s in the {@code Interval} class -
     * {@link #sweepLeftToRight} and {@link #sweepRightToLeft}. This method will only be executed if
     * the main comparator returns 0, i.e. if it considers the intervals to be equal. At that moment,
     * the start and end points would already have been compared to one another, which is why this method
     * should <strong>disregard the start and end points</strong> completely and only consider the
     * special properties defined in the particular subclass.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * It is vital to overwrite this method, if you have any properties in your subclass, that identify
     * the interval, such as for example user IDs, student IDs or room numbers. The two base comparators
     * are used within the underlying {@link java.util.TreeSet}s, which may discard two distinct interval
     * objects, that have the same start and end points.
